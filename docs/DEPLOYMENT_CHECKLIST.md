- [ ] Preview deployment tested
- [ ] Production deployment live
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend successfully
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

## End-to-End Testing

### Functionality
- [ ] Test query submission from frontend
- [ ] Verify response includes answer and contexts
- [ ] Test A/B variant switching (if implemented)
- [ ] Test source citations display
- [ ] Test error handling (invalid queries, network errors)
- [ ] Test loading states and UI feedback

### Performance
- [ ] Query latency < 2 seconds (target: < 1.5s P99)
- [ ] No memory leaks observed
- [ ] ChromaDB responses fast (< 500ms)
- [ ] Redis cache working (check hit/miss rates)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collecting properly

### Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Test on Chrome
- [ ] Test on Firefox
- [ ] Test on Safari
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

### Security
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic on Render/Vercel)
- [ ] CORS configured correctly (no wildcard in production)
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] API keys secured in environment variables
- [ ] Rate limiting considered (if needed)

## Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] Render logs accessible and monitored
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint working
- [ ] Error tracking configured (optional: Sentry)
- [ ] Uptime monitoring configured (optional: UptimeRobot)
- [ ] Alert notifications set up for critical failures

## Documentation

- [ ] Deployment guide completed (`docs/RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- [ ] README includes deployment section
- [ ] API documentation accessible at `/docs`
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide available

## Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Custom domain configured
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] Database backup strategy implemented
- [ ] Autoscaling enabled for production traffic
- [ ] Staging environment created
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline triggers automated deployments

## Post-Launch

- [ ] Announce deployment to team/users
- [ ] Monitor logs for first 24 hours
- [ ] Collect user feedback
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Plan for future iterations

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:
- [ ] Know how to rollback on Render (Events → Rollback)
- [ ] Know how to rollback on Vercel (Deployments → Redeploy previous)
- [ ] Have backup of environment variables
- [ ] Have backup of ChromaDB data (if applicable)
- [ ] Document rollback procedure for team
