# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, in its pursuit to fill the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

## Key Components

### Tokenization
Breaking text into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. This is typically the first step in NLP pipeline.

### Part-of-Speech Tagging
The process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Locating and classifying named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

### Sentiment Analysis
The use of natural language processing to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.

## Applications

- **Machine Translation**: Automatically translating text from one language to another
- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Understanding and responding to human queries
- **Text Summarization**: Automatically generating concise summaries of longer documents
- **Information Extraction**: Extracting structured information from unstructured text

## Challenges

Despite significant advances, NLP still faces challenges including:
- Understanding context and ambiguity
- Handling multiple languages and dialects
- Processing informal language and slang
- Dealing with sarcasm and irony
