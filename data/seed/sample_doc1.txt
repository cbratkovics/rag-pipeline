Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data and finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data. Clustering and association are popular unsupervised learning approaches.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns to perform an action from experience. It learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being explicitly taught.

Machine learning is widely used in various applications such as email filtering, detection of network intruders, computer vision, and natural language processing.
